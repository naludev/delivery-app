## Insta TragosInsta Tragos
**Insta Tragos** is a web platform designed to offer a drink delivery service, allowing users to order alcoholic beverages from the comfort of their homes. This project was developed as part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in full-stack development.

### Project Description
------------
This project consists of a **frontend** and a **backend**, each implemented with modern technologies to ensure a smooth user experience and a robust backend.

### Project Objectives
------------
This project was created with the goal of demonstrating my skills in **full-stack** development, including the integration of frontend and backend, deploying applications in production environments, and implementing patterns and best practices in web development.

#### Frontend
The frontend of **Insta Tragos** was developed using **React** along with **Vite** for a fast development process. Additionally, **Tailwind CSS** was used for responsive design and **TypeScript** for more secure and structured development. **Redux Thunk** was implemented for global state management, allowing efficient handling of asynchronous actions within the application.

#### Backend
The backend is built on **Node.js** and **Express**, using **TypeScript** for typing and better code maintenance. The database used is **MongoDB**, which allows efficient management of product and order data. The backend handles all necessary **CRUD** operations for *products*, *filters*, and *order management*, ensuring users have real-time access to information. **JWT** *tokens* are utilized for secure user *authentication* and *authorization*, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain features of the platform.

### Deployment
------------
Both the frontend and backend of Insta Tragos are deployed using **[Render](https://render.com/ "Render")**, a platform that offers a reliable and scalable environment for modern web applications.
