# Insta TragosInsta Tragos
**Insta Tragos** is a web platform designed to offer a drink delivery service, allowing users to order alcoholic beverages from the comfort of their homes. This project was developed as part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in full-stack development.

## Description
Insta Tragos comprises both a **frontend** and a **backend**, each crafted with cutting-edge technologies to ensure an intuitive user experience and a robust backend infrastructure.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in **full-stack** development, including the seamless integration of frontend and backend components, the deployment of applications in production environments, and the application of best practices and design patterns in web development.

## Frontend
The frontend of Insta Tragos has been developed using **React** for its component-based architecture, facilitating modular and reusable code. **Vite** was chosen as the build tool to streamline the development process with its fast, efficient bundling. The design is powered by **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface. To enhance type safety and code quality, **TypeScript** has been integrated throughout the project. **Redux Thunk** is used for managing complex state interactions, particularly those involving asynchronous operations like fetching data from the API.

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React components designed for reuse and scalability.
- **State Management**: Centralized state handling using Redux Thunk for efficient data flow and API interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal viewing and interaction across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used to catch errors early and enforce consistent data structures.

## Backend
The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, utilizing **TypeScript** to enhance code maintainability and clarity. **MongoDB** serves as the database, facilitating the efficient management of products and orders. The backend is responsible for handling all necessary CRUD operations related to *products*, *filters*, and *order management*, ensuring users receive real-time data. Additionally, **JWT tokens** are implemented for secure user *authentication* and *authorization*, safeguarding access to restricted features.

- **RESTful API**: Well-structured endpoints that handle all necessary CRUD operations.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- **Data Persistence**: MongoDB is used for storing product data, user details, and order information.
- **Scalability**: The backend is designed to handle increasing traffic and data load.

## Deployment
Both the frontend and backend of Insta Tragos are deployed using **[Render](https://render.com/ "Render")**, a cloud platform that offers a reliable, scalable environment for modern web applications. Render automates the deployment process, allowing for continuous deployment and easy scalability. The database is hosted on MongoDB Cloud, ensuring data is stored securely with high availability.
